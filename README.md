### Hi, my name is Nat

This is my GitHub page! I primarily use this account for work and school. I self-host my own Forgejo instance where you'll find my projects:

<https://git.nats.solutions/nat>

Some projects I've left up here because they have previously recieved contributions from other GitHub users, but my primary home is on Forgejo!
